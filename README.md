# Realtime-Human-tracking

Implemented an online version of ByteTrack algorithm for real time human and object tracking.
Run bytetrack_setup.ipynb for realtime ByteTrack

Also provided an easy way to convert models to Tensorflow/PyTroch/TensorRT using Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) protocol.
Run bytetrack_onnx.ipynb for ONNX model conversion.
